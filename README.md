### Information:
This is a POC demo created for one of my Mobile Robotics modules. 

The demo showcases simulated Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) for a mobile robot equipped with Sonar sensors
where potential obstacles are tracked via an Bayesian Occupancy Map and localisation is performed via probabilistic Monte Carlo techniques.

Please Note: This has dependencies on the Mobile Robots Aria SDK which is no longer available.
